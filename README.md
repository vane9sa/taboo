# 🌌 Naboo Love Adventure

A dreamy, interactive story-based game built in React where one girl journeys across the romantic planet of Naboo to reunite with the love of her life.

This game was created as a heartfelt gift for my girlfriend — inspired by the vibes of Padmé and Anakin's love story at the Villa Varykino 🥰
